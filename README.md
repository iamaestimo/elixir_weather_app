# Elixir/Phoenix Weather App

Phoenix LiveView framework app integrated with the WeatherAPI.com API. A user inputs a city/town or latitude/longitude and the app provides a 3 day weather forecast.

  * Get your own WeatherAPI.com API key from [here](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx)
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * In your shell, run `EXPORT WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key`, then,
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser and play around with the app.
